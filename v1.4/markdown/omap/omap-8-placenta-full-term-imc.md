# OMAP-8: Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Placenta with Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), v1.0

### Description
OMAP-8 was designed for Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24584193/) of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human term-placenta samples. The tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9, as described https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew). OMAP antibodies validated by immunohistochemistry and IMC were conjugated to polymers containing metal isotopes. Conjugated antibodies were used to stain processed human term-placenta tissue simultaneously. Regions of the processed tissue were then acquired on the imaging mass cytometer (Hyperion; Standard BioTools) by laser ablation and visualized. The panel contains 26 antibodies conjugated to unique metal isotopes and iridium marks the DNA. This OMAP provides a spatial context for key placenta cell types in the [ASCT+B v.1.0 table](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM446.WGLG.755).  Single-cell RNA sequencing data were used to guide marker selection for multiplexed tissue imaging. For example, ASCL2, HLA-G, PD-L1, CD68 and LYVE1 allow functionally specialized cell types to be visualized and quantified in the placenta. Note that one of our core antibodies is to LYVE1 but, unlike in other tissues where it is used to mark lymphatic vasculature, here we use it to mark the macrophage of the placenta (Hofbauer cells) – there should be no lymphatics in the placenta.
