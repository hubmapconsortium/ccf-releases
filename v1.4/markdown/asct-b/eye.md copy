# Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Eye v1.2

### Description
The Eye ASCT+B table v1.1 focused on representing key ocular anatomical structures including the neural retina, lens, cornea, iris, and ciliary body with a focus on vascular, epithelial, and neural cell types. Version 1.2 expands upon v1.1 with the addition of anatomical structures including the fovea and macula and cell types such as immune and endothelial. 

The table begins with a comprehensive list of retinal neural cells with as much resolution as is available in literature based upon immunohistochemical and single-cell transcriptomics data found in work by Peng et. al. and Gr√ºnert et. al. (DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.004, DOI: 10.1016/j.preteyeres.2020.100844). For example, amacrine cells are subclassified as GABAergic (CL:0011005), glycinergic (FMA:62362), medium-field, polyaxonal, and starburst.  The latter three designations are supported by literature but do not yet have Uberon identifiers, offering us an opportunity to expand the ontology database. Retinal neural types are still being fully characterized, and this table reflects the most recent morphological understanding of this highly complex tissue. 

The lens is less complex than the retina, containing only two major cell types. However, it contains metabolically distinct concentric rings. After discussion with multiple experts in lens biology, we have used generally accepted terms for these regions (epithelium, outer cortex, inner cortex, adult nucleus, fetal nucleus, juvenile nucleus, and embryonic nucleus). These regions contain many of the same cell types, and thus the same markers are represented in each region. We have also added metabolites and proteoforms that are unique to these lens regions from references such as Zhen Wang, Daniel J. Ryan, Kevin L. Schey, Localization of the lens intermediate filament switch by imaging mass spectrometry, Experimental Eye Research, Volume 198, 2020, 108134. Future work in collaboration with the Kelleher group and the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (https://www.topdownproteomics.org/) can assign unique and persisting accession numbers to lens proteoforms discovered using imaging mass spectrometry.
