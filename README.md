# CCF-HRA Releases

Common coordinate framework (CCF) releases contain necessary assets to build a human reference atlas (HRA):  
3D reference object library models of organs used in the registration user interface (RUI) and exploration user interface (EUI), 2D reference library objects of functional tissue units (FTU) from organs, anatomical structures, cell types and biomarker (ASCT+B) tables used to extend the uberon and cell ontologies and organ mapping antibody panels (OMAPs) that are validated antibody panels used in multiplexed antibody based imaging techniques. These assets are available from the [CCF-Portal](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf/).
