# Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Pancreas v1.1

### Description
[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. 

This version for Pancreas, v1.1, lists anatomical structures and cell types in the pancreas head region which are analogous to those for the pancreas neck, body and tail regions. Detailed annotation of the pancreas region will reduce redundancies in anatomical structure and cell type nomenclature representative of all pancreas regions and will improve visualization by the ASCT+B reporter by reducing multiple converging lines for a given structure or cell type from multiple regions.

The table begins with division of the pancreas head into lobules that are further divided into parenchyma followed by exocrine and endocrine pancreas. The ventral lobe of the pancreas is found exclusively in the head region and is the major source of pancreatic polypeptide cells found in islets of the ventral head region. The dorsal lobe of the pancreas comprises the remaining head region as well as the neck, body and tail regions accounting for the similarity in the structures and exocrine and endocrine cell types.   

Important findings from scRNAseq studies show division of most cell types into subtypes based on unique RNA signatures but such findings are outside the scope of this table. Single genes were also referenced to the Human Protein Atlas for protein abundance in the pancreas.

Immune cells are included though in low numbers as part of the innate immune system of the pancreas. The vascular, lymphatic, and nervous systems will be added in future versions.
