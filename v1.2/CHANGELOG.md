HuBMAP 3D Reference Objects ccf-release v1.2 Release Notes

The following reference organs were added with ccf-release v1.2:

spinal cord
placenta
small intestine measurements

Changes to ccf-release v1.0 models include:
Adjustments were made to the skin to account for the verterbral column and eventual addition of female breasts and gatrocnemius muscles.
The renal pelvis, major and minor calyxes, were added to the ureter model to better reflect the ontology distinction between kidney and ureter.
The nerves, ducts, muscles, some ligaments, and vasculature for organs are split according to 3D Reference Objects. Since these splittings were for UI/back-end reasons, while certain vessels are associated with many organs as general pathways, any one vessel is only ever in one blood vasculature “group”.
