# Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Lymph Node with IBEX v1.1

### Description
Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAP) [link to SOP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5749883) allow spatial mapping of the anatomical structures and cell types present in diverse organs (Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables) using multiplexed antibody-based imaging [Hickey et al, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01316-y). The panels are authored and reviewed by experts in pathology, tissue biology, and multiplexed imaging. Information on antibody lots and recommended concentrations vary across experiments and, in the case of antibody dilutions, must be empirically determined. 

The OMAP Lymph Node panel was designed for IBEX (Iterative Bleaching Extends multi-pleXity) imaging of fixed frozen human lymph nodes. The panel contains 39 antibodies and the nuclear marker Hoechst 33342 for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the ASCT+B lymph node table. Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers BCL2 and CD10 and CD138 and CD44 allow profiling of lymph node disease states, e.g.  follicular lymphoma malignancy and metastasis, respectively. The core and essential protein biomarkers detailed here overlap (~50-85%) with panels developed for multiplexed imaging of lymphoid samples using other technologies  and sample preparations (Ref). This OMAP does not contain antibodies for typing pericytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or different T helper lineages in situ.
