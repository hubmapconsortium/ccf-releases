model_type: 2d-ftu
description: "This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration was created from anatomical structures and cell types listed in the ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.1](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ccf-releases/v1.1/asct-b/ASCT-B_VH_Kidney.csv). This illustration was inspired and heavily influenced by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer/). Multiple histology atlases, especially “Human Microscopic Anatomy” (R.V. Krstić, 1994) and “Histology: A Text and Atlas” (Michael H. Ross, et al., 2003) were referenced. Sources for determining diameter include [(Hu, McDonough, and Layton 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102667).
