# Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Trachea v1.0

### Description
With revision of the Lung v1.2-1.3 revisions, the Trachea and the Main Bronchus were split out into separate ASCT+B tables as v1.0.  With the excellent assistance of Joshua Fortriede, Ellen Quardokus and Aleix Puig Barbe (EBI), Uberon and Cell Ontology were updated, terms added or revised where needed, AS-AS, AS-CT, CT-CT relationships corrected and verified. The provided gene markers were reviewed and updated based on recent scRNAseq lung cell type references.

Trachea, v1.0 table includes only the anatomical structures of the trachea as it extends from the cricoid cartilage to the point of branching into the right and left main bronchi at the carina. Gray's Anatomy The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice, the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists): Terminologia Anatomica (TA) were the main references used. In addition, Furlow PW, Mathisen DJ. Surgical anatomy of the trachea. Ann Cardiothorac Surg. 2018 Mar;7(2):255-260. doi: 10.21037/acs.2018.03.01., was consulted in which the adult trachea is described as: “The scaffolding of the trachea is comprised of 18 to 22 D-shaped “rings” with anterior and lateral walls made of C-shaped cartilage and a posterior membranous wall connecting the arms of the C (Figure). The trachealis muscle runs longitudinally on the posterior aspect of this wall and abuts the anterior esophagus. An intercartilaginous membrane connects the inferior edge of the upper cartilage to the superior edge of the cartilage below. There are approximately two rings of cartilage per centimeter of trachea and each tracheal ring is an average of 4 mm in height. The wall of the trachea averages about 3 mm in thickness. The average external diameter of the (adult) trachea is 2.3 and 1.8 cm in the coronal and sagittal dimensions, respectively.”  The blood supply to the trachea consists of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd branches of the inferior thyroid arteries originating in the subclavian arteries and supplying the upper “cervical” trachea, while the superior and middle bronchial arteries, and the inferior bronchial artery, usually originating from the descending and ascending aorta respectively, supply the lower “thoracic” trachea.

 Approximately 16 cell types of the trachea are named, including six cell types of the tracheal submucosal glands. Ciliated cells of the submucosal gland ducts are included though their existence remains to be demonstrated reliably and thus this cell type has not yet been added to Cell Ontology (CL). Structures and cells of the bronchial artery and bronchial vein are included in the Table though the inferior thyroid artery vessels are not yet added.  Detail of extracellular matrix of the basal lamina (lamina densa, predominantly type IV collagen and type V laminin), basement membrane, and reticular lamina (predominantly type III and V collagen and fibronectin) is anticipated in coming table versions. 

Gene markers up to the finest level of labeling available are from single cell RNAsequencing reference datasets.  The cell type gene markers have been revised from the previous Lung ASCT+B table.  The gene markers now represent a harmonization of the genes selected by 1) Azimuth Human - Lung v2 Azimuth References, 2) primary selections from “An integrated cell atlas of the human lung in health and disease (IHLCA, grateful for the assistance of Dr. Nawijn) https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.10.483747, 3) the original LungMAP Cell Cards publication https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2021.11.007  and the “Human CellCards Multi-Study CellRef 1.0 Atlas” doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.18.491687.  The markers selected can be reviewed at LungMAP.net. The cell type protein markers are classically referenced in the lung research literature and can be viewed in a number of references. A number of these markers will be demonstrated in multiplexed immunofluorescence data in preparation for the HuBMAP portal.

Standardization of trachea, bronchus and lung cell type nomenclature, ontology expansion, gene and protein marker identification continue by an organization of experts in the field, organized in cell type task forces, initiated on April 19, 2022 at the University of California San Diego, at a Lung Nomenclature Summit organized by the Developmental Lung Molecular Atlas Program (LungMAP).
