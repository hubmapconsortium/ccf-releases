# Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Knee v1.2

### Description
[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture the nested *part_of* structure of anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts.

This Knee v1.2 ASCT+B table is a major revision that focuses on one component of the structure of the knee (femoral condyle articular cartilage) and the chondrocytes that form this tissue.  AS: The current version of the 3D knee model does indicate the location of articular cartilage biopsies used for the snRNAseq studies, but the anatomical structure component of the table does not account for the different tissue components (bone and bone marrow, infrapatellar fat pad, synovium, ligaments, tendons, patella, meniscus).  CT: Similarly, the functional tissue unit of the articular cartilage does not distinguish the histologically defined cellular zones but instead regards the tissue as a uniform chondrocyte population that is distinguished by the clustering algorithms obtained from our ongoing snRNAseq studies.  The nomenclature assigned to each cluster does not reflect the compositional, biological or spatial relationships of articular cartilage but does utilize the current state of knowledge of snRNAseq for this tissue.  B: The gene IDs assigned to each cluster includes 3 of the non-overlapping and most highly correlated gene markers of each cluster.  This submission lacks the tissue and cellular complexities that allow the knee to respond to the external factors of mechanical load (compressive and tensile) and shearing forces all of which will be impacted by sex, age and systemic health.  

Future revisions of the Knee ASCT+B table will incorporate additional knee anatomy from on-going work to submit a 3D virtual model of the knee that is based on 3D NMR imaging and a functional tissue unit of articular cartilage utilizing a functional chondrogenic nomenclature. The latter is based on combinatorial gene expression patterns obtained from our ongoing multi-omic and snRNAseq data studies that will be integrated with our spatial transcriptomic technologies and spatial mapping studies.  This effort should allow for a deeper understanding of the cellular composition of articular cartilage and will appear in future versions of the knee ontology.
