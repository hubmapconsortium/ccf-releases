# Blood Vasculature Organ Crosswalk, v1.1

### Description
[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This table provides a crosswalk from vessels in the blood vasculature ASCT+B table to anatomical structures in other organ ASCT+B tables. The Relationship column indicates whether the vessel is “part_of”, “overlaps”, “supplies”, “drains”, “directly_supplies_drains”, “located_in”, or “connected_to” the anatomical structure in the BodySubPart column.

A vessel can relate to more than one anatomical structure; and, those relationships can occur in a particular order. For example, the vessel can pass through several structures along its length. The BodyPartSequence column indicates the sequence of those structures, from the proximal to distal end of the vessel. 

The BodySubPart structure is contained within the anatomical structure listed in the BodyPart column. The BodyPart is typically an organ or organ system. The FTU column indicates if the vessel is part of a functional tissue unit (the smallest tissue organization that performs a unique physiologic function in an organ). The angiosome column indicates if the vessel is associated with an angiosome (a region of muscle, bone, and skin supplied by a main artery).

IDs are provided for the Vessel, BodySubPart, BodySubPartSequence, BodyPart, FTU, and Angiosome columns to enable linkage to other datasets and ontologies.
