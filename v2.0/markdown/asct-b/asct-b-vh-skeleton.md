# Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) table for Skeleton, v1.0

### Description
[Anatomical Structures, Cell Types, plus Biomarkers (ASCT+B) tables](https://humanatlas.io/asctb-tables) aim to capture anatomical human body parts, the typology of cells, and biomarkers used to identify cell types. The tables are authored and reviewed by an international team of experts. This ASCT+B table contains a hierarchical “partonomy” of the human skeleton. The top level anatomical structure (“AS/1”) is “skeleton” for all structures. The second level (“AS/2”) divides the skeleton into “appendicular skeleton” and “axial skeleton”. The third (“AS/3”) and fourth (“AS/4”) levels further divide the skeleton by body region and sub-region, respectively. The fifth level (“AS/5”) lists individual bones. Finally, the sixth level (“AS/6”) contains bony landmarks and parts of bones. Note that the main purpose of this table is to provide a comprehensive list of bones and their location in the body. Individual bones, bone tissues, and joints might have their own ASCT+B table, which provides more detail about its anatomical structure, cell types and biomarkers.
