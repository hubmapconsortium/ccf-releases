# 2D Nephron Functional Tissue Unit (FTU) for Kidney, v1.2

### Description
This functional tissue unit (FTU) illustration includes cell types related to the nephron FTU in the ASCT+B Table [Kidney v1.3](https://cdn.humanatlas.io/hra-releases/v1.4/asct-b/asct-b-vh-kidney.csv). This illustration was inspired by the [Kidney Tissue Atlas Explorer](https://atlas.kpmp.org/explorer/)created by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). Multiple histology atlases, especially “Human Microscopic Anatomy” (R.V. Krstić, 1994) and “Histology: A Text and Atlas” (Michael H. Ross, et al., 2003) were referenced. Cell type diameters were primarily defined by [(Hu, McDonough, and Layton 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102667). In v1.2 of the 2D Nephron FTU for kidney, three insets were added: inner and outer medullary and cortical collecting ducts. Regional areas of the kidney were adjusted to reflect the ratio of the stripes against KPMP measurements. Minor revisions were also made in v1.2 to fix overlapping labels or labels in different layers of the ai file and to correct missing colors in some sections of the illustrations to use the svg file in the interactive FTU Explorer.

Note: These illustrations are a stylized representation of the average number and distribution of cell type populations within a functional tissue unit (FTU). Cell types are included based on their linkage to the FTU in each organ’s Anatomical Structures, Cell Type and Biomarkers (ASCT+B) Table. The intention is to illustrate relationships between individual cells and to include visual information on their relative shape, scale and distribution within the tissue. A relationship to blood supply is indicated.

We are working towards an understanding of cellular relationships within each FTU, as well as perfusion, innervation, structural and extracellular matrix support. Greater relationships of scale within the body are also considered. Smaller FTUs may be nested within larger FTUs.

This work is iterative and will be updated in regular publication cycles. In future releases, illustrations will be linked to data sets interactively. 

Machine learning and AI are employed in segmenting these FTUs from data which will be connected to the illustrations in future publication cycles.
