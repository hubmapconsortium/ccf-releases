# OMAP-4  Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP) for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Human Skin with Cell DIVE v1.1

### Description
OMAP-4 was designed for Cell DIVE multiplexed imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human skin. Cell DIVE enables highly multiplexed single cell analysis using antibody-based imaging (Gerdes, MJ. et al, 2013)  The tissue slides were prepared with a two-step antigen retrieval process (pH 6 and pH 9, as described https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpwumpew). Antigens were detected using either primary antibodies with fluorophore-labeled secondaries or fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies (protocol can be found https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4kgqutw). The panel contains 18 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image registration and nuclear segmentation. This OMAP provides a spatial context for most anatomical structures and cell types present in the [ASCT+B skin table, v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM423.RTRR.746).  Keratinocyte populations can be identified based on their spatial location, distinct morphology and, in the case of corneocytes, absence of nuclei.  Additionally, the inclusion of protein biomarkers DDB2 and p53 allow profiling of skin damage and aging effects. The panel was designed to get a broad representation of cell types found in the skin and in the future will be expanded to include dermal dendritic cell (DC) markers (e.g. Langerin, CD11c). This panel does not include markers targeting several immune cell subsets including Langerhans cells, mast cells, and gamma delta T cells.
