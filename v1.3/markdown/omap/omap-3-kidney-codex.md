# OMAP-3 Organ Mapping Antibody Panel (OMAP)  for Multiplexed Antibody-Based Imaging of Kidney with CODEX v1.1

### Description
OMAP-3 was designed for CODEX (CO Detection by IndEXing) of fresh frozen human kidney samples (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00556-8, https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.202048891). The panel contains 24 antibodies and the nuclear marker DAPI for image alignment and nuclear segmentation. Additional details on tissue preparation, panel design, image analysis, and representative images can be found in accompanying publications (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2021.08.033, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2021.100747). This OMAP provides a spatial context for all anatomical structures and most cell types present in the [ASCT+B kidney table v1.1](https://doi.org/10.48539/HBM673.ZZDK.622). Additionally, the inclusion of tryptase and MARCKS allow profiling of different regions in the glomeruli that are often affected by disease. Several cell types are identified by their morphology, location in the kidney, and expression of Cytokeratin 7. The panel was designed to provide a survey of the cell types found in the kidney and does not allow for granular phenotyping of immune cell populations. However, mast cells, NK cells, T cells, and B cells are broadly classified by several markers included in this OMAP. The core and essential protein biomarkers detailed here overlap (>40%) with a panel developed for multiplexed imaging of kidney samples using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) (10.1172/jci.insight.129477).
